# **Women**
# **Public Sector**
# **Jobs**

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Welcome to our analysis of Challenge 4
- Today we're examining a critical question about women's employment
- This affects millions of women across developing countries
- Team Table4 presentation
-->

<!-- _class: lead -->
# One Question

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Our entire analysis centers on one fundamental question
- It's a question that has divided economists and policymakers
- The answer has major implications for labor policy
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Magnet?
## or
# Catalyst?

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Does the public sector act as a MAGNET - pulling women away from private sector?
- Or does it act as a CATALYST - creating opportunities that expand overall female employment?
- This isn't just academic - it determines whether governments should expand or limit public hiring
-->

# The Context

Women in public sector:
✓ Better wages
✓ Work-life balance
✓ Less discrimination

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Across developing countries, public sector offers unique advantages for women
- More predictable wages and better work-family balance
- Stronger regulatory frameworks mean less discriminatory pay practices
- Result: Women's public employment shares are significantly higher than men's
- From README.WL: In some countries, women represent 52% of public sector vs 43% private sector
-->

# **47%**

Women in Maldives public sector

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Maldives has the highest public sector share in our dataset
- Nearly half of all formal employment is in the public sector
- This creates a natural experiment to study our question
- What happens when public sector is THIS dominant?
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Two Theories

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Economic theory gives us two competing predictions
- Both are plausible, both have evidence
- Our job: test them with real data
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# **Crowding Out**

Women queue for government jobs

Private sector loses talent

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Theory 1: High public wages raise women's "reservation wages"
- Women wait for government jobs rather than taking private sector positions
- This creates talent shortages in private firms
- From README.WL: Public sector workers earn 15-19% more in some countries
- Prediction: Higher public sector → Higher unemployment
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# **Crowding In**

Visible women leaders

Norms shift

More opportunities

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Theory 2: Women in public leadership change social norms
- Reduces gender discrimination across the economy
- Creates positive spillovers to private sector
- Encourages more women to enter workforce overall
- Prediction: Higher public sector → Higher female labor force participation
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# The Data

**1,141** observations
**137** countries

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- We merged three World Bank datasets
- Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators for public sector share
- Female Labor Force Participation rates
- Female Unemployment rates
- This gives us unprecedented cross-country coverage
- From README.WL: We can track wage premiums, sectoral composition, and gender representation
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Crowding Out?

Correlation: **0.253**

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- We tested the crowding out hypothesis first
- Does public sector correlate with higher unemployment?
- Result: 0.253 - a positive correlation
- This suggests SOME evidence of crowding out
- But wait...
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Weak

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- The correlation is WEAK
- In statistics, we'd call this a "small effect size"
- Public sector alone explains very little of the variation in unemployment
- This is NOT the dominant factor economists thought it might be
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Crowding In?

Correlation: **-0.118**

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Now testing the crowding in hypothesis
- Does public sector correlate with higher female labor force participation?
- Result: -0.118 - actually NEGATIVE
- This is the opposite of what the theory predicts
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Even Weaker

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Not only is it negative, it's even weaker than crowding out
- Essentially no relationship
- The spillover effects we expected? Not showing up in the data
- This is a surprising finding
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Same Public Sector
# Different Outcomes

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Here's where it gets really interesting
- Let me show you two countries with nearly identical public sector shares
- But completely different outcomes for women
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Norway
**62%** women working
**4%** unemployment

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Norway: 32.8% public sector
- 62% of women in the labor force - one of the highest in the world
- Only 4% unemployment - very healthy labor market
- This looks like the ideal outcome
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Saudi Arabia
**20%** women working
**24%** unemployment

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Saudi Arabia: 32.2% public sector - almost identical to Norway
- But only 20% of women in labor force - one of the lowest
- 24% unemployment - a crisis level
- Same public sector size, completely different outcomes
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Both have
# **32%**
# public sector

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Let that sink in
- Same public sector share
- Wildly different outcomes
- This tells us public sector size alone is NOT the determining factor
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Context
# **Matters**

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- What explains the difference?
- Context - the broader environment matters more than public sector alone
- Let's break down what "context" means
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Culture
# Economy
# Institutions

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Culture: Social norms about women working
- Economy: Overall development level, GDP per capita
- Institutions: Labor regulations, childcare support, discrimination laws
- From README.WL: We see this in wage premiums - women get 19% premium in some countries, 12% in others
- These factors interact with public sector in complex ways
-->

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Sectoral Patterns

Education: **68%** women
Health: **62%** women
Public Safety: **18%** women

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- From README.WL: Gender representation varies dramatically by sector
- Education and health are heavily female-dominated
- Public safety remains male-dominated
- This reflects both traditional roles AND evolving opportunities
- The "glass ceiling" exists: women hold 58% of professional positions but only 32% of management
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# The Answer?

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- So back to our original question
- Magnet or catalyst?
- After analyzing 137 countries and 1,141 observations...
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# **Neither**

Public sector alone doesn't determine outcomes

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- The answer is: Neither hypothesis is strongly supported
- Public sector is neither a powerful magnet nor a powerful catalyst
- It's a weak predictor of female labor outcomes
- This is actually the most important finding
-->

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Wage Bill Reality

**7.5%** of GDP
**35%** of government spending

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- From README.WL: Public sector wages are a MASSIVE fiscal commitment
- In some countries, 7.5% of entire GDP goes to public sector wages
- 35% of all government spending - the largest category
- Education alone: 78% of education budget goes to salaries
- Health: 72% of health budget goes to salaries
- This is why the question matters so much
-->

# One More Thing...

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Classic Steve Jobs moment
- There's one more critical insight from our analysis
-->

---

<!-- _class: lead -->
# Holistic
# **Approach**

Not just public sector policy

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- The solution isn't to simply expand or shrink public sector
- Need a holistic approach that addresses:
  - Cultural barriers to women working
  - Economic development and job creation
  - Institutional support (childcare, anti-discrimination laws)
  - Education and skills training
- From README.WL: Focus on breaking the glass ceiling - women are 58% of professionals but only 32% of managers
-->

# Key Recommendations

Time-series analysis
Regional clustering
Control for GDP & education

<!--
TALKING POINTS:
- Our analysis has limitations - it's cross-sectional
- Future work should:
  1. Track countries over time (time-series) to see causality
  2. Cluster similar economies (don't compare Norway to Saudi Arabia)
  3. Control for GDP, education levels, and regulations
- This will give us much clearer answers
