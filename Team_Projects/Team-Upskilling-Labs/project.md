## Challenge Category 3: Jobs and Youth

See [www.dc2.org/datadive](https://www.dc2.org/datadive) for details on this challenge area.

## Project Description

Team Upskilling Labs used AI to analyse and build visualizations exploring the future of education, jobs, and what youth skills will matter most in 2035.

The dataset represents over **847 million youth** globally, providing critical insights into educational attainment patterns, regional disparities, and future trends.

## Conclusion

The global youth education landscape shows **positive momentum** with steady improvements in educational attainment from 2025 to 2035. However, **significant disparities** persist between income levels and regions. The data reveals that while upper secondary education has become the norm for most youth, the transition to higher education remains limited, particularly in low-income countries.

**The critical challenge:** Ensuring the 270+ million youth in Sub-Saharan Africa and the 262 million in low-income countries receive quality education comparable to their peers in higher-income regions.

**The opportunity:** With focused investment and policy interventions during this 10-year window, we can dramatically improve educational outcomes for the largest youth generation in human history.
